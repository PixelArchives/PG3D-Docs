# Editor Crashing
Here are listed the reasons why editor may crash.

## LightingData
After decompiling, editor will crash when importing assets. (occured on Unity 5.3-2017.3)

Try going to folder with game scenes, and then moving all folders with lighting data outside Assets folder.

Deleting .meta files does help, but im not 100% sure.
